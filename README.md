## About me

Hello! I’m interested in flight simualation (and real world aviation too!).  
I am mainly interested in building software/hardware solutions for home cockpits and desktop flight simulation.  
This is from small button/switch boxes, through to complete working replica panels.  
I'm still new to this area, but have an example project [here](https://youtu.be/HxthydQtna8).

I'm also interested in model railways, and really enjoy implementing automation into those.  
I have built my own large model railway, and some of this can be seen on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/TonyDocksStation)

## Goals & Aspirations 

Eventually, I would love to work in real world aviation and avionics software.  
I have a keen interest in Airbus as I am familiar with their software and avionics,  
but am able to work across Boeing and General Aviation too.
