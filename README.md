## About me

Hello! I’m interested in flight simualation (and real world aviation too!).  
My flight simulation interests are in building software/hardware solutions for home cockpits and desktop flight simulation. 
<!-- 
I'm also interested in model railways, and really enjoy implementing automation into those.  
I have built my own large model railway, and some of this can be seen on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/TonyDocksStation) -->

My interests within academia are currently in computer science, specifically <em>Natural Language Processing</em> with an emphasis on the effects of creativity.
I have a published paper (details below) in this area, and will continue my research into a PhD. I am looking to collaborate in this, and similar areas.

## Goals & Aspirations 

Currently, my aim is to complete my undergraduate degree and move into a PhD. 

I would also like to explore work within real world aviation and avionics software.  
I have a keen interest in Airbus as I am familiar with their software and avionics, but am able to work across Boeing and General Aviation too.

## Academia

My most recent publication is in the [17th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing](https://www.ieee-icsc.org/)
<em>"Assessing the Effects of Lemmatisation and Spell Checking on Sentiment Analysis of Online Reviews"</em>

I’m currently a full time university student studying BSc (Hons) Computer Science at the University of Kent (UK).  
I am in my final year and will be graduating this summer. I currently have an application to continue on into a PhD after graduating.
